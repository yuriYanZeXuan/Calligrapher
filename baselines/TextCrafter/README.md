TextCrafter enables precise multi-region visual text rendering, addressing the challenges of long, small-size,various numbers, symbols and styles in visual text generation. We illustrate the comparisons among TextCrafter with three state-of-the-art models: FLUX, TextDiffuser-2 and 3DIS.
* We propose **TextCrafter**, a novel *training-free* framework for rendering multiple texts in complex visual scenes, consisting of three key stages: instance fusion, region insulation, and token focus.

* We construct a new **CVTG-2K** dataset, which encompasses a diverse range of visual text prompts varying in position, quantity, length, and attributes, serving as a robust benchmark for evaluating the performance of generation models in **C**omplex **V**isual **T**ext **G**eneration tasks.

* We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the **CVTG-2K** benchmark. The results demonstrate that **TextCrafter** delivers exceptional performance, proving its superior effectiveness and robustness in tackling the CVTG task.

## 💡  Methodology

<img src="assets/readme_images/architecture.png" width="100%">

TextCrafter consists of three steps. (a) *Instance Fusion*: Strengthen the connection between visual text and its corresponding carrier. (b) *Region Insulation*: Leverage the positional priors of the pre-trained DiT model to initialize the layout information for each text instance while separating and denoising text prompts across different regions. (c) *Text Focus*: Enhance the attention maps of visual text, refing the fidelity of text rendering.

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone this repo: 
```
git clone https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/TextCrafter.git
cd TextCrafter
```

Build up a new environment and install packages as follows:
```
conda create -n textcrafter python==3.9 -y
conda activate textcrafter
pip install xformers==0.0.28.post1 diffusers==0.32.2 peft==0.14.0 torchvision==0.19.1 opencv-python==4.10.0.84 sentencepiece==0.2.0 protobuf==5.28.1 scipy==1.13.1 six==1.17.0 gurobipy==12.0.0 matplotlib==3.9.4 fire==0.5.0
```

## 🧨 Inference

Running the simple code below to perform inference verify whether the environment is correctly installed.
```bash
cd TextCrafter_Flux # or cd TextCrafter_SD3
python demo.py
```
If you downloaded the [FLUX.1 dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) or [SD3.5](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large) model in advance, please specify the model path in `demo.py`.

**Parameter Description:**

`prompt`: Text description of the entire image.

`carrier_list`: A list of the carriers/locations of each visual text, which can be concrete objects or abstract concepts, but must come from the prompt.

`sentence_list`: A list of individual descriptions for each visual text, which you can extract from the prompt.

`pre_generation_steps`: The number of inference steps required in the pre-generation process. Only a few steps are needed to obtain a rough layout.

`insulation_steps`: The number of reasoning steps performed by *Region Insulation*. The number of insulation is higher, which means the object position is more accurately controlled, but the boundaries may be more obvious.

`num_inference_steps`: Total number of sampling/inference steps.

`cross_replace_steps`: In the *Text Focus* stage, the proportion of steps that perform attention reweight operations

`min_area`: The minimum area of the rectangle when optimizing the layout of each visual text. This parameter should be set to different values ​​for different numbers of visual texts. It is recommended that (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) visual texts correspond to (0.65, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.12) respectively.

`addition`: In the *Instance Fusion* stage, the control coefficient of embedding addition.

## 📚 Dataset

CVTG-2K is a challenging benchmark dataset comprising 2,000 prompts for complex visual text generation tasks. Generated via OpenAI's O1-mini API using Chain-of-Thought techniques, it features diverse scenes including street views, advertisements, and book covers. The dataset contains longer visual texts (averaging 8.10 words and 39.47 characters) and multiple text regions (2-5) per prompt. Half the dataset incorporates stylistic attributes (size, color, font), enhancing evaluation capabilities. CVTG-2K provides fine-grained information through decoupled prompts and carrier words that express text-position relationships, making it ideal for advancing research in visual text generation and stylization.

After downloading [CVTG-2K.zip](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dnkdnk/CVTG-2K) and extracting it, you will see two folders:

- **CVTG**: Contains data without attribute annotations
- **CVTG-style**: Contains data with attribute annotations

Inside each folder, you will find JSON files named with numbers, such as `1.json` (with fine-grained annotations) and `1_combined.json` (without fine-grained annotations). The numbers in the filenames represent the quantity of visual text regions, ranging from 2 to 5.
